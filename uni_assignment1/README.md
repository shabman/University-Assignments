# Missouri S&T Computer Assignment #6
_Programming Language Used: C++11_

**Brief**

```
Please note that this is an example assignment only! It will not be collected and graded.

For this assignment you will submit three files for the program project. I have explained in class what they should be. In brief: one file will contain the main function for your program; one file will be the header file containing the prototypes for your functions and your global constants; and the third file will contain the definitions of the functions used in your program. Be sure to include the standard comment header at the top of each file. Also, be sure to include the pre-processor directives in the header and the appropriate user includes. And, be sure to put using namespace std; in each file.

The purpose of this assignment is to give you more practice designing and using funcitons to make your programs easier to understand and maintain. You will also discover the utility of using pass-by-reference parameters in functions.

Specifications: Your program is to allow the user to run its functionality as many times as he/she desires before terminating the program run. That is, the user inputs data and your program provides output and then prompts the user for input again if desired. You know how to arrange that by now. The data is a positive binary number (base 2 -- 1's and 0's only) of no more than 8 digits. Read this value in as an int type value. The first job of your program will be to make sure that it is indeed a binary number (only 1's and 0's). If it isn't, then the user is prompted again. If it is binary, then your program is to calculate the equivalent decimal value (base 10 -- the number system we commonly use). Of course, the output should be beautiful. Maybe something like:

 
           binary input:      00110101
           decimal equiv:           53
           
The output of the binary is to include all leading 0's , and this may be the most difficult part of the assignment. Don't underestimate the time it will take you to devise this program. It very well may turn out to be a short program, but you'll have to think hard about this one and put more time in on it.
Don't forget to comment your code! If there is any code that isn't painfully obvious about how it works, write a comment to the right side of the "page" telling the reader what it does. Be sure to include function descriptions, Preconditions, and Postconditions for each of your functions and prototypes. Use functions extensively! You will be graded according to how well you do this.

When you submit, enter the following values to have converted to decimal:

 
        11111111
               0
           11010
        12100001       corrected to 11100001
            -101       corrected to      101
If you have any questions, be sure to ask. Good luck. 
```

*Note: I did not do everything in this assignment because I didn't feel like it.*

# Final Result
